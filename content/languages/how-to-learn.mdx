Even though it's good to remember why you're learning a language, to keep your motivation,
I don't really have a reason (school, work, family etc.). But, it unlocked a world of new content I can enjoy!

Some other good read:

## Getting input

This is absolutely the most important. Music, YouTube, Instagramâ€¦ consume whatever content you normally enjoy, but try switching to your target language. The key is to have fun ðŸ¥³.
