Even though it's good to remember why you're learning a language, to keep your motivation, I don't really have a reason (school, work, family etc.). But, it unlocked a world of new content I can enjoy!

## Getting input

This is absolutely the most important. Music, YouTube, Instagramâ€¦ consume whatever content you normally enjoy, but try switching to your target language. The key is to have fun ðŸ¥³.

Some other good read:

- [Stephen Krashen on Language Acquisition](https://youtu.be/NiTsduRreug)

  You've probably heard of "comprehensible input", which is a theory proposed by linguist Stephen Krashen.
  "We acquire language in one way and only one way, when we get comprehensible input in a low anxiety environment."
